This is our submission for [ROBOHackIT 2022](https://robohackit.devpost.com/).

## Inspiration
Many study tools nowadays are not easily accessible or free. We aimed to build an app that made studying simple and efficient.

## What it does
The user specifies the subject they want to study and problems are then taken from a problem set with adaptive difficulty. The user also has the options to customize their study experience by entering preferred difficulty, feedback, and number of problems.

## How we built it
We built this application mostly using Android Studio. We used a few Python Scripts to create the question files.

## Challenges we ran into
Some of the challenges we ran into were figuring out a way to get and represent question. Originally, we did not have enough information per question and we created too many question files, which made it difficult to keep track of.

## Accomplishments we are proud of
It was our first app development experience and our first time participating in a hackathon. Overall, we are proud of the amount of work we were able to do.

## What we learned
We learned the basics of app development and UI, ie. activities, layouts, etc.

## What's next
There is definitely a lot of room to improve. One of our ideas is to add more types of problems (free response, matching) and a feature for teachers to be able to create their own problems (Teacher account/Student account).
